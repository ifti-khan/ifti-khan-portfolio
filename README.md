## Personal Portfolio

### Introduction

This repository is showcasing my first milestone project for The Code Institute.

I have chosen to do a personal portfolio project showing my employment history, skills, hobbies, interest and other development projects. It will showcase various skills, techniques and technologies such as HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap, that I have learnt and encountered throughout the course, to which I will then apply to creating my first milestone project.

The project will be fully responsive so that it can be viewed and accessed on all device sizes. This project is the first of many project and will be the main foundation for my other development projects, as I continue to learn, grow and progress throughout the course I will add more technologies to help me advertise my skills and experience to future employers.


## UX – User Experience

### The who?
The websites sole purpose is to display my development skills for future employers and job recruiters. Not only will it display my development skills but will also advertise my work experiences, education, extra skills, hobbies and interest.

### The what?
This website will help future employers and recruiters get a better understanding of myself through a number of easy digestible web pages that are advertising and showing off my work experiences, education, hobbies, interest and skills as well as my development skills which will have live links to my other projects.

They will also be able to view my CV in a pdf format online and will have the option to download the CV as well. The website will also have a contact form, so that future employers and recruiters can get in direct contact with me through the website.

### The how?
All the information will be taken from my CV and then changed, to give it more of an elegant style and then broken down into easy digestible chunks which will get website visitors straight to the point.

The website will also incorporate an eye catching design that will draw website visitors into know more about myself by visiting the other web pages. If the website visitor want to know more they will be able to view and download my CV with link provided by me. I will also incorporate a built in contact form that will allow visitors to get in direct contact with me. Live links to my other projects will also be provided for the users so that they can visit my other projects and see my development skills live.

    - HTML5 was used to create the overall structure and page elements to be viewed in a web browser.

* CSS3 -> [Visit Site]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
    - CSS3 was used to give my project and its content style, layout, colours, a different font and format.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Tools Used

    * Brackets is the text editor that I downloaded and used to create my project.

* Bootstrap 4.5.2 -> [Visit Site]( https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/)
    * I will use bootstrap for the styling of my project , it will also be used for responsive features for my project.

* GitHub -> [Visit Site]( https://github.com/)
    * I used GitHub to store my project files by creating a repository for it and then using the Git terminal and its commands to version control and store my files.

* Git Terminal Desktop -> [Visit Site]( https://git-scm.com/)
    * Git is the terminal program I used to commit and push my files to my GitHub repository to store my files and version control.

* GitHub Desktop -> [Visit Site]( https://desktop.github.com/)
    * GitHub desktop was used to clone my online repositories to my local storage so I could edit my project files using Brackets and also to create new files and directories for my online repository locally and then using the Git terminal to commit and push to my GitHub repo.

* Balsamiq Desktop -> [Visit Site]( https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/desktop/)
    * Balsamiq was used in the design stage where I created my wireframes for my project to help me get visual representation of what my project could look like.

* Google Fonts -> [Visit Site]( https://fonts.google.com/)
    * Google fonts has been used to import my various font directly from google into my main CSS file.

* Font Awesome Icons -> [Visit Site]( https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery)

* Table Generator -> [Visit Site](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)
    * This online tool helped with my further testing section of my readme file. It allowed me to create the tables for testing, then i saved the file as a CSV file.
    Then I uploaded the CSV file to the site to convert the CSV data into a markdown table format.

# Validation
Here in this section I will be showing a variety of different validation techniques to thoroughly make sure my project website is fully compliant. I will use the W3C HTML5 and CSS3 online validation tools to check my project is compliant.

I will also use an online contrast checker to make sure my colours meet web accessibility standard. If there is any non-compliant code within the project it will be documented and then fixed and this will be the first step of my testing and debugging.

# Testing
When it came to testing and debugging I found it easier to test and debug as I went along using Chrome Dev Tools. Every time I started a new page or section for my project I made sure that I fully tested it to make sure it worked correctly. This can be seen in my Git commit messages to my repository every time I pushed my completed files.

In this section I will test my project by testing against my user stories, features and functional testing. I will also be conducting different test using different browsers and a variety of different screen sizes as well to ensure my projects compatibly and responsiveness.

# UX - User Story Testing
The projects main purpose is to display myself to potential recruiters by providing a CV link and displaying my work history, education, skills and interests. Also a way for the recruiter to get in contact with me. So to test my project I will give examples of certain features by looking back at my user stories.

## UX User Story Testing Document -> [Visit Document](writeup_files/testing/user_story_testing.md)

# Further Testing
I have decided to further test my project by listing all features and functions by creating a list in a table format and then manually test each one. I will test my project in a variety of different browser to ensure it is fully compatible. The browsers I have chosen are Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Opera. I will test to see if all of the features and functions work as well as my font, images and project responsiveness.

## Further Testing Document -> [Visit Document](writeup_files/testing/further_testing.md)

To add to the further testing I used Chrome Dev tools whilst programming my project and used the responsive tool to simulate different device sizes. I also did some physical testing on a few devices such as my Samsung Galaxy S10+, Samsung Galaxy Tab 6, Dell Inspiron 15inch Laptop and my Acer 24inch Monitor.

# Known Issues
* The contact form in the contact me page is not connect to a mail server and cannot send emails. To address this issue I added a message page to inform that this site feature is currently under construction and to email me directly by displaying my email.

* In my resume page I have a small issue and that is to do with the CSS overflow scroll. It currently works but the height has a fixed value and cannot be set to an automatic height for every screen size.

# Deployment
I used GitHub pages to deploy my project which is currently uploaded and published on my GitHub. Before my project was deployed, I used GitHub for version control and the development of my project.

During the development stage I had my project located in a directory called personal portfolio, but once the project was finished I then moved it to main root directory before I deployed my project.

The way that I deployed the project was by going to the settings of my GitHub repository and then scrolled down to the GitHub pages section and published my site, which then informed me that my site was published and gave me a live URL.

## Deployed Project -> [Visit Site](https://ifti-khan.github.io/ifti-khan-milestone-project-1/)

Whilst developing my project I ran my code locally by using a program called Brackets, which had a Live Preview feature. The reason I used Brackets is that the live preview was a click of a button within the program and the features allowed me make live changes to the HTML5 code as well as the CSS3 code, whilst it was open in a browser without refreshing the page or creating a local server through CLI.
